**Cinematic Trajectories: Analyzing Actor Development Patterns in the Film Industry Using IMDb Datasets and Time-Series Clustering**

Abstract:

Understanding actor development patterns in the film industry is crucial for filmmakers, producers, and industry stakeholders. Leveraging IMDb datasets and time series clustering analysis, this study examines the trajectories of 752 actors over 20 years. 

Results reveal seven distinct clusters, showcasing varied career trajectories characterized by factors such as leading/non-leading roles and top/non-top-ranked movies. Findings underscore the importance of empirical analysis in understanding actor careers and offer insights for strategic decision-making within the film industry. 

Future research could explore additional factors influencing actor development patterns and incorporate sentiment analysis for deeper insights into movie success and audience reception.
